# 👋 Hi, I'm Joseph Venturi

☁️ Cloud Engineer | 🎖 Army Ranger Veteran | 🌴 Southern California native

As a Cloud Operations Engineer, I'm actively building and documenting projects — many of which are showcased right here on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/josephventuri) and on my personal website at [josephventuri.io](https://josephventuri.io).

Before transitioning into tech, I served in the U.S. Army as an Army Ranger. That experience shaped my mindset around discipline, learning under pressure, and solving problems — all of which I bring into my cloud work.

Outside of tech, I love reading, music, and being outdoors. I grew up in Southern California and still love the beach and the sunshine. I'm passionate about the rapid innovations happening in cloud infrastructure and excited to be part of its future.
