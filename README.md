## About Me

I'm a disciplined, mission-focused cybersecurity professional with an Army Ranger background specializing in **incident response**, **threat detection**, and **SOC operations**. I protect wealth managers and their clients by leading investigations, coordinating remediation, and building repeatable defense processes.

I bring the same operational discipline from the 75th Ranger Regiment to cybersecurity operations — executing under pressure, thinking in systems, and continuously refining processes until they work flawlessly.

**How I operate:**
- Triage alerts from multiple tools and case queues; classify threats accurately
- Execute containment and remediation actions; validate recovery
- Threat hunting and detection engineering to reduce dwell time
- Create and maintain playbooks, runbooks, and SOPs for repeatable response

## Background

Before transitioning to cybersecurity, I served in the **U.S. Army as an Army Ranger** with the 75th Ranger Regiment. That experience shaped my approach to security operations:

- Execute under pressure and stay mission-focused
- Think in systems and continuously refine processes
- Study, test, and question how things work until they make sense
- Document and build repeatable, scalable defenses

I hold a **Secret Security Clearance** and bring **7+ years of client-facing and leadership experience** to cybersecurity operations.
